            As a Realtor&reg, I am dedicated to catering my services to each client in a highly customized way, whether they might be buying, selling, or renting a residential real estate property. It is my duty to keep my client's best interest at heart, while meeting all contractual deadlines in a timely manner, as well as communicating and negotiating with all involved parties &#40the Realtor&reg and client on the other side of the transaction, escrow company, title company, mortgage lender, inspector, appraiser, property manager, repair team, etc.&#41 in an efficient, professional way.

            <div id="top-right-modal">As a classical pianist, my focus is on collaborative music: meaning, I am accompanying a soloist &#40an instrumentalist or a vocalist&#41 at various events they may need me for, whether it be a lesson with their teacher, a competition, an academic recital, or a large-scale concert. It is my job to be familiar not only with my part of the music, but also with my client's part of the music so that I can always remain flexible enough to immediately adjust in case of unforeseen circumstances or spontaneous musical decisions occur on the stage.</div>
            <div id="middle-modal">I seek to be a highly disciplined, solutions-driven software engineer who always strives for maximum efficiency in function and creative design in everything I do. My 13+ years experience as a collaborative pianist who has served over 900 individual clients, as well as a self-taught composer who has composed nearly 100 works points to my creativity, flexibility, and collaborative skills necessary in working with other developers on a collaborative project. My 5+ years experience as a licensed real estate agent for various sellers, buyers, and tenants points to the fact that I am able to handle multiple deadlines in a timely manner while negotiating and working collaboratively with different involved parties to solve all problems that may arise.</div>
