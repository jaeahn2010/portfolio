    <section id="bio">
        Jae Ahn-Benton was born in Seoul, South Korea. At age 5, he started taking piano lessons with Sun-Kyung Kim. At age 10, Jae moved to Las Vegas, NV, where he continued his piano studies with Roger Bushell, participating in various competitions and performances. He also began to compose music around this time. At age 11, Jae joined his middle school MathCounts chapter, where he participated in math competitions and also discovered his love of coding by experimenting with the programming features of his TI-83 calculator. In high school, he expanded his coding knowledge by taking a computer science course that focused on Java. After graduation, he attended the University of Nevada, Las Vegas as a major in piano performance, under guidance of Mykola Suk. During these college years, he found his niche to be in collaborative piano, accompanying various intrumentalists and singers on their performances, auditions, recordings, and competitions. Meanwhile, he continued to be a self-taught composer as well as an arranger of pop and classical music. He also kept up coding as a hobby; in 2016, Jae briefly studied C++ on his own. In 2017, Jae married the love of his life Maria, a beautiful Ukrainian girl and a fellow classical pianist. In 2019, wanting to expand his skill set beyond music, Jae obtained his real estate license and joined the Blankfeld Group of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, under guidance of Harvey Blankfeld. Jae's family grew exponentially since then: in 2020, Jae and Maria adopted a cat named Smokey; in 2021, Maria gave birth to their beautiful daughter Zara; in 2022, Maria's younger brother escaped the devastating war in Ukraine and immigrated to the USA to live with Jae and Maria. It was then Jae began to wonder again about making software engineering more than just a hobby; before the end of the year, Jae took a self-paced course on the basics of Python, which he immensely enjoyed but still had trouble committing time to it consistently. In 2023, Jae finally decided to take a chance in fully pursuing his passion for software engineering as his main career, and joined General Assembly's immersive bootcamp. Even though he is still working as a collaborative pianist and a real estate agent while studying software engineering, Jae maintains a positive attitude, always trying to do better for his family, who have been steadfastly supportive, patient, and flexible. On his spare time, Jae loves to travel to different places with his family, and also enjoys learning to speak different languages.
